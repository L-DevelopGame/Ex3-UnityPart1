Spaceship Game,Things I changed from lecture are:
* Add 3 Life to Spaceship, after 3 lifes get destroyed.
* PickUp shield that protect you for 5 sec.
* You can see how much enemies have been destroyed
* Unique edit is when you pick the shield , your spaceship get speed and move faster.

You can try the game on [Itch.io-SpaceShips](https://liron02319.itch.io/ex3-unity1)
